# Figma Example

To run the example, you need to have a Figma API token. You can get it by following the instructions [here](https://www.figma.com/developers/docs#authentication).

This can be passed as a `define` variable to the `dart` command:

```bash
dart --define=FIGMA_TOKEN=<token> --define=FILE_KEY=<file_key> example.dart
```
