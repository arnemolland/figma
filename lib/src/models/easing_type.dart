/// This type is a string enum with the following possible values:
///
/// - `EASE_IN`: Ease in with an animation curve similar to CSS ease-in.
/// - `EASE_OUT`: Ease out with an animation curve similar to CSS ease-out.
/// - `EASE_IN_AND_OUT`: Ease in and then out with an animation curve similar to
/// CSS ease-in-out.
/// - `LINEAR`: No easing, similar to CSS linear.
/// - `EASE_IN_BACK`: Ease in with an animation curve that moves past the
/// initial keyframe's value and then accelerates as it reaches the end.
/// - `EASE_OUT_BACK`: Ease out with an animation curve that starts fast, then
/// slows and goes past the ending keyframe's value.
/// - `EASE_IN_AND_OUT_BACK`: Ease in and then out with an animation curve that
/// overshoots the initial keyframe's value, then accelerates quickly before it
/// slows and overshoots the ending keyframes value.
/// - `CUSTOM_CUBIC_BEZIER`: User-defined cubic bezier curve.
/// - `GENTLE`: Gentle animation similar to react-spring.
/// - `QUICK`: Quick spring animation, great for toasts and notifications.
/// - `BOUNCY`: Bouncy spring, for delightful animations like a heart bounce.
/// - `SLOW`: Slow spring, useful as a steady, natural way to scale up
/// fullscreen content.
/// - `CUSTOM_SPRING`: User-defined spring animation.
