/// If no error occurs, `"images"` will be populated with a map from node IDs to
/// URLs of the rendered images, and `"status"` will be omitted. The image
/// assets will expire after 30 days. Images up to 32 megapixels can be
/// exported. Any images that are larger will be scaled down.
///
/// Important: the image map may contain values that are `null`. This indicates
/// that rendering of that specific node has failed. This may be due to the node
/// id not existing, or other reasons such has the node having no renderable
/// components. It is guaranteed that any node that was requested for rendering
/// will be represented in this map whether or not the render succeeded.
///
/// To render multiple images from the same file, use the `ids` query parameter
/// to specify multiple node ids.
